These detachments specialise in fighting psykers and daemons.

Though highly secretive, the elite Grey Knights of the Imperium are a prime example of such forces.

[NOTE]
====
This niche ability is only for use by agreement between the players, for special scenarios.
It does not have a points cost -- you need to allow for its likely value in the overall context of the scenario and the composition of the armies that the players will use.
====

Where your detachment has the {daemonbane} ability:

* In close combat, double the Assault value of each unit in the detachment that is in base contact with an enemy Daemon or {psyker} unit.
* When you shoot with this detachment, apply a -1 modifier to the Armour value of each Daemon unit and each {psyker} unit in the target detachment.

[NOTE]
====
We define a Daemon unit as any of these units in the Chaos faction: any unit in a Daemon Detachment; any Daemon Prince unit.
