= FF Blast

`Detachment ability`

Some forces are able to disrupt their firefight opponents, for example by using the sonic weapons of Slaaneshi Noise Marines.

[NOTE]
====
'CC Blast' and 'FF Blast' are temporary names -- we hope to settle on better names for these abilities in future.
In a perfect world, these abilities will have names that are evocative and yet which also neatly hint at the relatedness of their distinct yet similar gameplay effects.
Easier said than done!

Where your detachment has the {ff-blast} ability and takes part in a firefight:

* After rolling to resolve the firefight, every enemy detachment that was within 15 cm of your detachment gains one Blast marker. This effect does not stack with other detachments with the {ff-blast} ability.
