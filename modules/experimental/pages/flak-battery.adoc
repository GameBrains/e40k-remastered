= Flak Battery

`Data sheet modifier`

These units are specially adapted from their original design, so that they can engage enemy flyers.

---

Where your unit has the {flak-battery} ability, apply these changes relative to its base unit:

* Halve its Firepower value (round up).
* Add the {flak} special ability.
// TODO: I'm not sure about the best phrasing here, or for other cases like Hero and Self-propelled Artillery. "Apply the {X} special ability" might be taken to imply that we should add the ability text to the data sheet, which is a bit redundant. Perhaps "Apply the {X} special ability rules" is slightly better in this regard? Or perhaps we can find a still better way to present this?
// IJW note: The special ability should be added to the unit, so that it can appear in the final calculated data sheet.
