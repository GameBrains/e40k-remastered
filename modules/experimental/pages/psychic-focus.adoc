= Psychic Focus

`Detachment ability`

Some detachments contain many low-level Psykers, not powerful enough to have the usual effect in an assault.

Where your detachment has the {psychic-focus} ability:

* The detachment has a free Psychic Blast card with a value of 0, that can only be used by this detachment.
* Psychic Fate Cards can be played from any unit in the detachment, not just from {psyker} units.
