Where your detachment has the {psychic-focus} ability:

* The detachment has a free Psychic Blast card with a value of 0, that can only be used by this detachment. When you use this card, roll a D6. On a roll of 4+ the card takes effect.
* Psychic Fate Cards can be played from any unit in the detachment, not just from {psyker} units.
