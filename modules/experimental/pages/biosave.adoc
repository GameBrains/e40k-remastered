= Biosave

`Unit ability`

These units are unusually resilient; they often remain functional in spite of damage that would cripple most war engines.

---

Where your unit has the {biosave} ability:

* When the unit suffers a hit that causes critical damage, from any source, roll a D6. On a roll of 4+, ignore the critical damage and do not roll on the Critical Damage Chart. The Damage Capacity of the War Engine unit is still reduced by one by the hit.

[NOTE]
====
This ability works in a similar way to the {save} ability, but only against critical damage.
