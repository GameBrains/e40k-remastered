= Frenzy

`Detachment ability`

The troopers in this detachment are filled with bloodlust and the joy of battle.

Where your detachment has the {frenzy} ability:

* The detachment has the {stubborn} ability during the Assault phase, so you may re-roll failed Leadership tests.
* In close combats, the detachment gets a +1 bonus to the assault resolution roll. This bonus does not stack with the bonus from other detachments with {frenzy}, or with the bonus for having more {psyker} units.
