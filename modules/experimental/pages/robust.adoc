= Robust
:robust: Robust

An experimental rule for normal units with Damage Capacity 2, slightly similar to a War Engine unit.

[TIP]
====
These units require 2 hits to destroy, and count as 2 units for hit allocation and detachment strength.

This ability is being tested for units that are tougher than the standard rules allow, but not as tough as War Engine units.
For example Land Raiders, Stompas, and Greater Daemons.

---

Where your unit has the {robust} ability, apply these rules:

* The unit starts the game with Damage Capacity 2. Each hit reduces its Damage Capacity by 1. When the unit's Damage Capacity is reduced to 0 it is destroyed.
* The unit counts as *2* units for hit allocation.
** When shooting at the detachment, your opponent must allocate 2 dice to the unit before allocating dice to more distant targets.
// Editing note, I've just used 'dice' here rather than 'successful hit dice'.
** Where possible, your opponent must allocate 2 dice that are equal to or higher than the unit's Armour value, *or* 2 dice that are lower than the unit's Armour value.
+
TIP: The aim of this restriction is to reduce the number of units with 1 remaining point of Damage Capacity by forcing the attacker to kill the unit or bypass it.

** A third die cannot be allocated to the unit until all eligible units have had a die allocated to them, and so on.
** In close combat, a third hit cannot be allocated to the unit until all eligible units have had a successful hit allocated to them, and so on.
* Each remaining point of Damage Capacity counts as 1 unit for the strength of the detachment.
* The unit counts as *1* unit for all other purposes, including 'ganging up' in close combat, how many hit rolls it makes in close combat, supporting a close combat, and for the number of units covered by a {barrage} template.
* Any hit that automatically causes Critical Damage, such as a hit from a {death-ray} weapon, will reduce the unit's Damage Capacity to 0, destroying the unit.

IMPORTANT: Units with the {robust} ability are not War Engine units and do not follow the rules for War Engine units.

.Detachment strength
====
A Space Marine detachment contains:

* 1 Captain
* 6 Land Raiders with {robust}, so they each have Damage Capacity 2
* 5 Terminator units

The detachment has a strength of 18, so gets +1 to Leadership tests, and is reduced to half strength when it has 9 remaining units and Damage Capacity.

.Shooting hit allocation
====
image::damage-capacity-shooting.png[Orks shooting at Space Marine Terminators and Land Raiders.]

The Space Marine detachment of Terminators (Armour 5+) and Land Raiders (Armour 6) has been shot by an Ork detachment.
The Orks have made six rolls of 5 or more, so have 6 dice to allocate to units.

. The first die must be allocated to Terminator 1.
. The next 2 dice must be allocated to Land Raider 1. They must both be rolls of 6 that can affect the Land Raider, or both be rolls of 5 that cannot affect the Land Raider.
. The fourth and fifth dice must be allocated to Terminators 2 and 3.
. The last die must be allocated to Land Raider 2.
