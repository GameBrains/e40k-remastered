= CC Blast

`Detachment ability`

Some forces are able to disrupt their close combat opponents, for example by infecting them with Nurgle's Rot.

[NOTE]
====
'CC Blast' and 'FF Blast' are temporary names -- we hope to settle on better names for these abilities in future.
In a perfect world, these abilities will have names that are evocative and yet which also neatly hint at the relatedness of their distinct yet similar gameplay effects.
Easier said than done!

Where your detachment has the {cc-blast} ability and takes part in a close combat:

* After rolling to resolve the close combat, every enemy detachment that was in base contact with your detachment gains one Blast marker. This effect does not stack with other detachments with the {cc-blast} ability.
