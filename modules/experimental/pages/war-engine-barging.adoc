= War engine barging

Two experimental options for barging enemy units out of the way when charging with a war engine.

[TIP]
====
The main purpose of these options is to allow charging war engine units to get into base contact with more than one enemy unit.

The two options are very similar, the differences have been marked in _italic_ text.

== War engine barging (DC)
During an Assault move, war engine units can barge enemy units out of the way.

. Move the war engine into base contact with an enemy unit, following the standard Assault move rules.
. _The war engine can continue to move, barging aside enemy units it contacts._
. _As soon as the war engine contacts half its starting DC in enemy units, stop its Assault move even if it has movement left._
. After finishing the Assault move, the opposing player places their barged units in base contact with the war engine, as close as possible to their original positions.

NOTE: Enemy war engines *cannot* be barged aside.


== War engine barging (5 cm)
During an Assault move, war engine units can barge enemy units out of the way.

. Move the war engine into base contact with an enemy unit, following the standard Assault move rules.
. _The war engine can move a further 5cm or the remainder of its Speed (whichever is shortest), barging aside enemy units it contacts._
. After finishing the Assault move, the opposing player places their barged units in base contact with the war engine, as close as possible to their original positions.

[NOTE]
====
Enemy war engines *cannot* be barged aside.

_Remember war engine units can only attack or be attacked by units equal to half the war engine unitâ€™s starting Damage Capacity._
