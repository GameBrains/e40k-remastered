= Other assault moves

For all your detachments that are on Assault orders, you must move all of their units *at least 5cm* -- unless you can move them less but still get them into close combat (base contact with enemy units).

* You don't have to move these units more than 5cm, unless you want to.
* You *must* move these units *towards the enemy* -- but not necessarily towards the _nearest_ enemy, and you don't have to declare and make a charge into close combat unless you want to.
+
(You may simply want to manoeuvre into range for a *firefight* or to grab an objective, for example.)
+
However, you may not move assaulting units *past* any enemy units -- unless those enemies are already engaged in close combat with other friendly units.
To avoid a lengthy explanation here we discuss this in more detail at [FAQ: Moving past in the Assault phase].
