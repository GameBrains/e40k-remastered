= CC1. Add up Assault values

Both players: Add up the Assault values of all your units that are in base-to-base contact with the enemy.
A maximum of two units can 'gang up' on each enemy unit.

Also, add a further +1 to the total for each other unit that is in your detachment that is involved in the combat and which is within 15cm of the enemy.
This represents the effects of their supporting fire.
