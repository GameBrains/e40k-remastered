= Charging into close combat

During the Assault phase you may only move and attack with detachments that you placed on Assault orders in the Movement phase.

As you move detachments in this phase, you may declare that any or all of them will *charge* into close combat.
This is the only time that you are allowed to move your units into base contact with enemy units.

* In a charge, you may double the Speed value of *infantry* units *if* this will bring them into base contact with enemy units.
