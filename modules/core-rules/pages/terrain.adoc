= Terrain

The terrain of the battlefield will be a big factor in many of your tactical decisions.
You must consider the risks and opportunities that the terrain presents to both your own forces and those of your opponent â€” not only at the start but also as the battle progresses.

Aside from the obvious fact that some types of terrain may block the line of sight between opposing units, there are other effects too.

== Terrain effects -- movement

Terrain affects the movement of ground units in one of three main ways:

* *No effect*: The unit can move through the terrain as normal.
* *Impassable*: The unit cannot move through the terrain at all, under any circumstances.
* *Dangerous*: The unit can attempt to enter the terrain but it might get stuck, or even suffer damage.
When you wish to move a unit through dangerous terrain you must take a <<Dangerous terrain test>> for that unit.

The effects often differ between _unit types_.

=== Dangerous terrain test

When you wish to move a unit into dangerous terrain, or when you wish to move a unit that is already in dangerous terrain, roll a D6: On a roll of 1, halt the unit at the edge of the terrain.
If the unit is halted in this way, roll the D6 again: If you roll another 1 then the unit takes a hit.

NOTE: Hits from dangerous terrain do *not* cause critical damage on war engines.

=== Roads

Where you will move a unit such that its entire move will take place on a road -- in any phase -- add 5cm to its Speed value for that move.
Apply this bonus to the unit's base Speed value, before modification.

.Movement on roads
====
A unit of Ork Boyz infantry is on March orders.
The player will make the first two moves entirely on roads, and the third move will include open ground.

So, the player could move the unit up to a total of 40cm: 30cm for the first two moves ((10cm Speed value + 5cm road bonus) x2 moves on roads) and up to 10cm for the third move.

== Terrain effects -- shooting

=== Line of sight blocking terrain

Some terrain may block the line of sight between opposing units. This isn't always as clear-cut as you might think, so it pays to talk about particular terrain pieces and principles with your opponent before you start the battle.

+[More explanation needed.]+
// TODO: Add some detail here about 'model's eye view', hull-down, and such. Might need to rationalise with the main rules for the Shooting phase too.

=== Armour bonus for infantry that are in cover
//Some terrain offers useful cover for infantry units, which we represent as a bonus to their armour while they are in such terrain.

Infantry that are 'in cover' -- that is, in terrain that provides ready concealment and/or physical protection from incoming munitions -- gain special benefits.
This is because they can take advantage of cover in ways that vehicles and war engines just can't -- they can hide among trees and shrubs, crouch behind low walls and dive into dips and holes at a moment's notice. 

We represent this with a bonus that increases the Armour value of any infantry unit that is in such terrain -- see the Infantry Armour Bonus column in the summary table.

NOTE: It is not possible to get an Armour value greater than 6. 

.Armour bonus for infantry that are in cover
====
Infantry that are in woods get a +1 bonus to their Armour value.
A unit of Ork Boyz infantry has a base Armour value of 4.

So, while in woods, a unit of Ork Boyz infantry would benefit from a modified Armour value of 5.
