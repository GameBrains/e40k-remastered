= S5. Roll for shooting hits and discard misses

Take a moment to savour the tension and to make an evil grin while you tell your opponent that all his alien scum or whatever are going to die... and then:

. Roll the hit dice.
. Discard any hit dice which scored less than the target detachment's lowest Armour value.
. The remaining dice are hits.
