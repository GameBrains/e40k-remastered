= Broken detachments

Mark Broken detachments with the Order dice.

A detachment becomes Broken when:

* It loses a close combat.
* It loses a firefight.

A Broken detachment must retreat when it breaks, and may make a retreat move in a subsequent Movement phase if the player desires.
It is not allowed to move or shoot otherwise, and has its Assault value and Firepower halved for close combat and firefights.
Note that the only type of move a Broken detachment can make is a retreat move; a Broken detachment is not allowed to move normally, or march, enter overwatch, etc.

A retreat move may be up to 20cm, regardless of a unit's actual Speed.
Retreat moves may be made in any direction, and the normal terrain rules apply, but if a unit ends a retreat within 15cm of the enemy, it is destroyed (it is 'killed while trying to escape'!).
Units that are 'out of command' (more than 30cm from their detachment HQ unit) are not affected if their parent detachment is Broken (so they don't have to retreat).
Conversely, if a unit that is out of command is Broken, then it is destroyed with no other effects on the parent detachment.

After Blast markers have been removed in the Rally phase Broken detachments can attempt to rally by passing a Leadership test.
A detachment can't rally if the number of Blast markers on the detachment is equal to or greater than the number of units in it.
