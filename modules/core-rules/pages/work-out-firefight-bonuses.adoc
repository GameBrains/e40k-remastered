= FF2. Work out firefight bonuses
:firefight:

Each player receives bonuses in firefights for the Firepower value of their units, whether they are supported by psykers and so on.
These are summarised on the <<#assault-bonuses-table>>.
As in close combat the bonus you receive for the Firepower of your units depends on how it compares with your opponent's Firepower, you don't add your Firepower straight onto your dice roll!
