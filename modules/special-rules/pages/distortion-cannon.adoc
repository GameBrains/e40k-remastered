= Distortion Cannon

These weapons literally distort reality.
They create a momentary rift between reality and the warp,  and in the blink of an eye this rift will tear the target apart or even vanish it from reality forever.

The rift is not big enough to vanish a large target like a war engine, but a good hit will inflict severe damage.

When you shoot with a {distortion-cannon}:

* Pick any target within range and line of sight, even a specific unit in a detachment.
* Roll a D6 and multiply the roll by 5, to get a score in the range of 5 to 30. A score that is equal to or greater than the target's Speed value is a hit.
Also, a roll of 1 (score 5) is always a miss, 6 (score 30) is always a hit.
* {distortion-cannon} hits ignore Void Shields and Power Fields.
* A {distortion-cannon} hit on a War Engine unit always causes critical damage.
Roll on the target War Engine's Critical Damage table.
