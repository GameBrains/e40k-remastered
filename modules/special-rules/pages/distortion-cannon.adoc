= Distortion Cannon

These weapons literally distort reality.
They create a momentary rift between reality and the warp,  and in the blink of an eye this rift will tear the target apart or even vanish it from reality forever.

The rift is not big enough to vanish a large target like a war engine, but a good hit will inflict severe damage.

When you shoot with a {distortion-cannon}, roll a D6 and multiply the result by 5, to get a score in the range of 5 to 30.
If the score is equal to or greater than Speed value of the target unit then the weapon hits.
Also, a result of 1 (score 5) is always a miss, 6 (score 30) is always a hit.

If you hit the target unit then apply damage according to its type:

* War Engine unit: Ignore any shields and apply one hit which *automatically* causes critical damage.
* Units with a Damage Capacity of 1 (any unit other than a war engine): Destroyed.
