= Mega Cannon

These are huge pieces of ordnance that shoot a single, giant explosive munition at the target, so powerful that it blasts through any cover.

---

When you make a {mega-cannon} shot:

. Place a Barrage template in the standard way.
. For each unit covered by the template, roll a D6.
If you roll the unit's Armour value or higher then the unit suffers a hit.
Use only the unit's actual Armour value -- that is, *ignore any Infantry Armour bonus for cover*.
. Place one Blast marker on each detachment that had any units under the template, in addition to any other Blast markers that you would normally place.

NOTE: With a {mega-cannon} shot, you can only hit the specific units that are actually under the template.
This is different to a {barrage} shot in which we simply add the number of units under the template to the Firepower total and then allocate hits as normal.

.Multiple {mega-cannon} shots
// TODO: Need to introduce this properly, not just sneak it in within an example.

A Warlord Titan is shooting two Mega Cannons.
A Barrage template is placed for each {mega-cannon} shot, affecting an Ork Warband detachment and an Ork Kult of Speed detachment.

* The first template covers Ork Boyz (1) and (2), and one of the Gunwagons, but the centre of Boyz (3) is not covered by the template.
* The second template covers Ork Boyz (4) and all three Gunwagons.
* Roll to hit Ork Boyz (1), (2), and (4), and the two leftmost Gunwagons.
Roll to hit the central Gunwagon twice, as it is covered by both templates.
* Place one extra Blast marker on the green Ork Warband detachment, as it is covered by one template.
* Place two extra Blast markers on the red Kult of Speed detachment, as it is covered by two templates.
