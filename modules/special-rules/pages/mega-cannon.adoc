= Mega Cannon

These are huge pieces of ordinance that shoot a single, giant explosive munition at the target.
The effect is similar to a barrage, but even more powerful.

+[TODO: Is it actually similar to a {barrage} weapon though? See notes below]+

---

When you shoot with a {mega-cannon}:

. Place a Barrage template over the target.
. Roll a D6 to hit each unit under the template.
Use only the target unit's Armour value -- that is, *ignore any infantry armour bonus for cover*.
. Place one Blast marker on the target detachment, in addition to any other Blast markers that you would normally place.

[TODO: Clarify in what ways the placement of the template is or is not the same as for {barrage} weapons. The original FAQ seems to imply that multiple {mega-cannon} shots from a single war engine could be placed adjacent rather than all in one place. Also the {mega-cannon} rules and the FAQ seem to imply that you roll to hit for the specific units under the template(s). All of which is quite different to {barrage} weapon rules and might lead to some unexpected edge cases.]+
