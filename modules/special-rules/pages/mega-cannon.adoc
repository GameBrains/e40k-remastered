= Mega Cannon

These are huge pieces of ordinance that shoot a single, giant explosive munition at the target, so powerful that it blasts through any cover.

---

When you shoot with a {mega-cannon}:

. Place a Barrage template so that it:
* is completely within range and line of sight of the firer
+
NOTE: Units that also have {artillery} do not need line of sight to the template.
. For each unit covered by the template, roll a D6. If you roll the unit's Armour value or higher, the unit suffers a hit.
Use only the unit's Armour value -- that is, *ignore any infantry armour bonus for cover*.
Unlike a {barrage}, these are the only units that can be hit by the shot.
. Templates cover:
* Infantry units (INF) if the centre of their base is under the template
* Vehicle units (VEH) and war engine units (WE) if any part of their base is under the template
+
[NOTE.e40k]
====
In comparison to _Epic 40,000_, we use the centre of an Infantry unit's base to determine if it is covered, instead of relying on the number of models on the base.
====
. Place one Blast marker on each detachment with any units covered the template, in addition to any other Blast markers that you would normally place.

A Warlord is firing two Mega Cannons.
A Barrage template is placed for each Mega Cannon, affecting an Ork Warband detachment and an Ork Kult of Speed detachment.

* The first template covers Ork Boyz 1 and 2, and one of the Gunwagons, but the centre of Boy 3 is not covered by the template.
* The second template covers Ork Boy 4 and all three Gunwagons.
* Roll to hit Ork Boyz 1, 2, and 4, and the two leftmost Gunwagons. Roll to hit the central Gunwagon twice, as it is covered by both templates.
* Place one extra Blast marker on the green Ork Warband detachment, as it is covered by one Mega Cannon template.
* Place two extra Blast markers on the red Kult of Speed detachment, as it is covered by two Mega Cannon templates.
