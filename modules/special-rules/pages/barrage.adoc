= Barrage

These weapons can saturate a wide area of the battlefield with intense salvoes or giant explosions.

---

TIP: The more closely packed the units of the target detachment, the more effective {barrage} weapons are likely to be against it.
This is simply because the barrage will have more target units within its area of effect.

//+[IJW editing note: I've changed this to plural as you almost always have multiple barrage weapons being resolved at once.]+

When you shoot with a detachment that includes units with {barrage} weapons:

. Place a single Barrage template over the target detachment, no matter how many {barrage} units in your detachment are firing at them.
. Place the template so that it:
* is completely within range and line of sight of all units contributing to the {barrage}
* covers as many units as possible from the target detachment.
+
NOTE: Units that also have {artillery} do not need line of sight to the template.
. Templates cover:
* Infantry units (INF) if the centre of their base is under the template
* Vehicle units (VEH) and war engine units (WE) if any part of their base is under the template
+
[NOTE.e40k]
====
In comparison to _Epic 40,000_, we use the centre of an Infantry unit's base to determine if it is covered, instead of relying on the number of models on the base.
====
. The number of covered enemy units in the target detachment is the Firepower value for each {barrage} unit contributing to the attack.
. Add this to the total Firepower that the detachment brings to bear on the target detachment.

IMPORTANT: For the placement of Blast markers, count a {barrage} shot along with regular Firepower and not as a super-heavy weapon.

.A classic {barrage} unit
====
The Space Marine Whirlwind armoured vehicle is armed with a Whirlwind missile launcher.
What this vehicle lacks in range it can make up for in speed and the ability to rain a destructive barrage of missiles down onto an area of the battlefield.

.Adding up Firepower
====
Three Space Marine Whirlwinds are firing at an Ork detachment.

* The Space Marine player places one Barrage template for all three Whirlwinds.
* The template covers Ork Boyz 1 and 2, and the Gunwagon, but the centre of Boy 3 is not covered by the template. In total, the template covers three units
* Each Whirlwind therefore adds 3 Firepower to the Space Marine detachment's Firepower.
