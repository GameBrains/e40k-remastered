= Barrage

These weapons can saturate a wide area of the battlefield with intense salvoes or giant explosions.

---

TIP: The more closely packed the units of the target detachment, the more effective {barrage} weapons are likely to be against it.
This is simply because the barrage will have more target units within its area of effect.

//+[IJW editing note: I've changed this to plural as you almost always have multiple barrage weapons being resolved at once.]+

When you shoot with a detachment that includes units with {barrage} weapons:

. Place a Barrage template over the target detachment.
Place it in the standard way, but with these additional considerations:
* Place only a single template, no matter how many {barrage} units in your detachment contribute to the attack.
* Place the template so that it is completely within range and line of fire of *all* of the {barrage} units that contribute to the attack.
You may opt to have some units *not* contribute to the attack, but you may not make any separate attack with them against the same target detachment (you may still split fire with these units if there are other suitable target detachments).
* Cover as many units in the target detachment as possible.
+
NOTE: Where a shooting unit also has the {artillery} ability the you do not need a line of fire to the template for that unit.
. The number of covered enemy units in the target detachment is the Firepower value for each {barrage} unit contributing to the attack.
. Add this to the total Firepower that the detachment brings to bear on the target detachment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you place Blast markers, {barrage} weapons contribute to the detachment's total Firepower, instead of the number of super-heavy weapons.

For suppression by Blast markers, each {barrage} weapon is a single super-heavy weapon, so can be suppressed by 1 Blast marker.

.A classic {barrage} unit
====
The Space Marine Whirlwind armoured vehicle is armed with a Whirlwind missile launcher.
What this vehicle lacks in range it can make up for in speed and the ability to rain a destructive barrage of missiles down onto an area of the battlefield.

.Adding up {barrage} Firepower
====
Three Space Marine Whirlwinds are shooting at an Ork detachment.

* The Space Marine player places one Barrage template for all three Whirlwinds.
* The template covers Ork Boyz (1) and (2), and the Gunwagon, but the centre of Ork Boyz (3) is not covered by the template.
* Ork Boyz (4) is ignored as it is not in the target detachment.
* In total, the template covers three units from the target detachment.
* Each Whirlwind therefore adds 3 Firepower to the Space Marine detachment's Firepower.

// TODO IJW: decide how to determine if detachments are intermingled, and if it's needed.
