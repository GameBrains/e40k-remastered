= War engines in firefights

War engines participate in firefights in much the same way as other units.

* Count the Firepower of each weapon system that has at least one enemy unit within fire arc and within 15 cm.
//IJW editing note: firefights aren't restricted by line of fire, so this has to refer to the weapon arc instead.
* Count 1 Firepower for each ranged super-heavy weapon system that can draw a line of fire to at least one enemy unit within 15 cm, regardless of the number of shots it has.
