= Synapse Creature

These organisms impose the will of the Hive Mind directly on their swarm.

---

Apply these rules to units with the {synapse-creature} ability:

* The presence of these units is required for their detachment's {synapse} or {brood-telepathy} ability.
* Their detachment's {synapse} or {brood-telepathy} ability only functions while the detachment contains {synapse-creature} units.

TIP: This ability has no effect on the unit itself, but it marks which units must be present for the {synapse} or {brood-telepathy} ability to function.

+[TODO: choose one of the two bullet points.]
