= Shooting with war engines

When you reach the "Shoot with war engines" step in the turn sequence then it is time to shoot with your War Engine units.
This is usually a moment of high drama and excitement -- will your carefully positioned behemoths live up to their fearsome reputations and lay waste to the enemy?

== Weapon mounts

Every War Engine unit has a number of weapon mounts.
We list each of these in a separate line on the unit's data sheet.
Usually, each weapon mount holds one weapons system, either a super-heavy weapon or some set of weapons that has a basic Firepower value.

* While you may split fire to target different detachments with different weapon mounts, you may not split fire with the effects of a single weapon mount.
* For critical damage results, apply effects that destroy or restrict a weapon to the whole weapon mount.
{blank}[TODO: If we reference 'weapon mount' rather than 'weapon' on every data sheet in future, perhaps we can do away with this bullet point?]
* Where a weapon mount holds weapons that do not have a basic Firepower value, treat it as a single super-heavy weapon and apply all the rules as normal for a single super-heavy weapon:

_Epic 40,000_ mentions 'weapon mounts' but does not define the term or use it consistently.
We've integrated various references to make a robust definition that helps us to make certain rules more clear and precise.

== Weapon arcs

Each weapon mount on a War Engine unit has an arc that constrains the line of fire for weapons in that mount.
You may only use weapons that are on that mount against targets that are within that arc.
We use icons on the War Engine data sheets to show what arc applies to each weapon mount.

The arrow in the centre of each icon shows the facing of the war engine.
The black segment shows the weapon arc of the mount.

From top-left to bottom-right, these icons represent:

[none]
* diagonal left (180º); ahead (90º); front (180º); diagonal right (180º)
* left (180º); all round (360º); rear (180º); right (180º)

====
In _Epic 40,000_ there are only ahead 90º, side 180º and 360º 'weapon fire arcs'.

We add more options, including diagonal 180º arcs for the arm weapon mounts on titans and gargants.
We also use the term 'weapon arc' rather than 'weapon fire arc', to be more inclusive of weapon systems that may not have a ranged component, such as {ripper-tentacles}.
