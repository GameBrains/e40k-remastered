= Jump Packs

Equipped with a variety of jet packs, wings etc, these units take long bounding leaps rather than flying, and often make good assault troops.

---

Apply these rules to {jump-packs} units:

* Double their original Speed value.
* During Assault moves, their original Speed value is tripled if this will bring them into base contact with enemy units, or doubled if it won't.
* During Assault moves, they can move over enemy units that have already been contacted.footnote:[This is a popular change to the original rules.]
* During any move, they ignore the effects of terrain as long as they don't end their move in the terrain.

+[TODO: Decide if terrain effects apply if they *start* their move in terrain.]+
