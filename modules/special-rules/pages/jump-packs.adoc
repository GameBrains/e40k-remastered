= Jump Packs

Equipped with a variety of jet packs, wings etc, these units take long bounding leaps rather than flying, and often make good assault troops.

---

Apply these rules to {jump-packs} units:

* Double their Speed value in the Movement phase and for Reserves.
* During the Assault phase, triple their Speed value if it will bring them into base contact with enemy units.
* Ignore the effects of any piece of terrain as long as they don't start or end a move in the terrain.


* When moving, ignore the effects of any piece of terrain as long as they don't end their move in it.


+[TODO: Make a decision about moving over engaged enemy units during Assault moves. Decide if terrain effects apply if they *start* their move in terrain.]+
