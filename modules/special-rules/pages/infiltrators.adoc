= Infiltrators

These units are the expert scouts and commandos who gather information, set ambushes, sabotage installations, and so on.

---

Apply these rules to {infiltrators} units:

* Count them as *in command* while they are within 60cm of their HQ unit, rather than the usual 30cm.
However, they are still destroyed if they become Broken and they are more than 30cm away from their HQ unit.
* You may deploy them up to 30cm outside of your normal deployment zone for the scenario you are playing.
Or, if they are not deployed at the start of the battle then, in the turn when they arrive, you may add +30cm to their first move -- even if their first move is to disembark from transport vehicles or drop pods.
