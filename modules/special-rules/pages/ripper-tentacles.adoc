= Ripper Tentacles

These are biological symbiote weapons, unique to Tyranid bio-titans.
They seem to have a mind of their own, as they writhe and strike under the control of nerve bundles that are separate from the bio-titan's main cortex.

The hulking ropes of muscle and sinew are immensely powerful, able to trap the combat machinery of opposing war engines.

Apply these rules where your War Engine unit is armed with {ripper-tentacles}:

* In close combat with opposing war engines, choose one {close-combat-weapons} system -- the {ripper-tentacles} wrap around and trap that weapon system, which means that the opposing War Engine unit cannot use it in the close combat.

+[TODO: Presumably, if in close combat with multiple opposing war engines, you can only choose one CCW from among the opponents, not one each. Also, as part of a wider question, should weapon arcs apply to {ripper-tentacles} and {close-combat-weapons}?]+
