= Synapse

Swarms of Tyranids that contain Synapse Creatures are controlled directly by the Hive Mind.

---

Apply these rules to detachments with the {synapse} ability:

* If the detachment includes any units with the {synapse-creature} ability:
 ** The detachment has the {dauntless} ability so automatically passes all Leadership tests.
 ** The detachment has the {unbreakable} ability so cannot become broken.
+
NOTE: The detachment must retreat if it loses a close combat or firefight, but does not become broken.

* If the detachment loses all its {synapse-creature} it loses the {dauntless} and {unbreakable} abilities.
