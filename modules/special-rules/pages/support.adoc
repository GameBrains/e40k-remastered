= Support

`Data sheet modifier`

These units are specially adapted from their original design, to specialise in close support of other units.

[NOTE.e40k]
====
This ability expands the experimental _Epic 40,000_ {siege} ability by increasing the unit's Firepower value to a minimum of 2, without requiring a separate ability.

Where your unit has the {support} ability, apply these changes relative to its base unit:

* Change its Range value to `15 cm`.
* Add the {close-support} ability.
* If its Firepower value is less than `2`, increase the value to `2`.
