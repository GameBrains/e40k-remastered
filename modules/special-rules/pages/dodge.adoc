= Dodge

Some formations of very mobile and agile troops -- such as the Dark Angels Ravenwing -- can dodge and jink so effectively that they reduce the effectiveness of incoming fire.

Apply these rules to detachments with the {dodge} ability:

* If you wish to place any detachments on Dodge orders then you must do this in the Start phase.
* While on {dodge} orders:
 ** All units in the detachment increase their Armour value by one, to a maximum of 6.
 ** The detachment halves its Firepower.
