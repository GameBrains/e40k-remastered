= Dodge

Some formations of very mobile troops can dodge and jink so effectively that they are hard to target.

[NOTE.e40k]
====
This ability is equivalent to _Ravenwing_ in _Epic 40,000_ -- we call it {dodge} instead so as not to imply that the ability is faction-specific.

We also made these rules fit with the new Start phase.

---

Where your detachment has the {dodge} ability, you can use special orders called Dodge:

. If you wish to place any detachments on Dodge orders then you must do this in the Start phase.
. Place the {special-orders} marker to indicate that the detachment is on Dodge orders.
While Dodge orders are in effect:
 ** Increase the Armour value of all units in the detachment by one, to a maximum of 6+.
 ** Halve the total Firepower of the detachment detachment.
