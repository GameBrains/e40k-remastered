= Disrupt

These are weapons of disruption rather than destruction.
They entangle or confuse target units, or force them to scatter. 

When you shoot with a {disrupt} weapon, roll a D6: on a 4+, place one Blast marker on the target detachment in addition to any other Blast markers that you would normally place.

{disrupt} weapons inflict no actual damage in game terms.
