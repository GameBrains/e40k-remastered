= No Retreat

`Detachment ability`

Some forces never retreat from combat, no matter how bad it gets.

[NOTE.e40k]
====
In comparison to _Epic 40,000_, we separated this ability from part of the 'No retreat, no surrender' rules for war engines, along with the new {unbreakable} ability.

Where your detachment has the {no-retreat} ability:

* After you lose a close combat or firefight with the detachment, do *not* make a Retreat move with it.
Units in your detachment that remain within 15 cm of enemy units are *not* destroyed.

{blank}[TODO: We should add something about what happens if a {no-retreat} unit starts a turn in base contact with the enemy, as at link:https://thehobby.zone/resources/e40k-compendium/Content/More/HouseRulesFrequentlyAskedQuestionsAndOtherNonsense/FAQ_StartingTheTurnInContactWithTheEnemy.htm[FAQ: Starting the turn in contact with the enemy]]
