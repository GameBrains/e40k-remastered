= No Retreat

Units like War Engines never retreat from combat.

Apply these rules to detachments with the {no-retreat} ability:

* The detachment does not retreat after losing a close combat or firefight.
* They are not destroyed for being within 15cm of enemy units after losing a close combat or firefight
