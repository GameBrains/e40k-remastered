= Jungle Fighters

`Unit ability`

Some infantry are especially well adapted to jungle fighting.

[NOTE.e40k]
====
This ability is equivalent to the _Kroot_ ability in _Epic 40,000_ -- we call it {jungle-fighters} instead so as not to imply that the ability is faction-specific.

Where your unit has the {jungle-fighters} ability:

* Treat woods and jungle terrain as fortifications for this unit.
That is, when the unit is in cover in woods or jungle terrain, apply a +2 Infantry Armour bonus for cover rather than the usual +1.
