= Death Ray

These weapons focus colossal amounts of energy at a point, to destroy a single target even at great distance.

The technology and form varies; but almost every major warring race in the 41^st^ millennium uses {death-ray} weapons of some sort.

---

When you shoot with a {death-ray} weapon:

* For each {death-ray} shot, pick any target within range and line of sight, even a specific unit in a detachment.
* For each {death-ray} shot, roll a D6. If you roll a 2+, the target suffers a hit regardless of Armour values and regardless of cover.
* A {death-ray} hit on a War Engine unit always causes critical damage.
Roll on the target War Engine's Critical Damage table.
