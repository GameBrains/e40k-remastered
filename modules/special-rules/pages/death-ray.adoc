= Death Ray

These weapons focus colossal amounts of energy at a point, to destroy a single target even at great distance.

The technology and form varies; but almost every major warring race in the 41^st^ millennium uses {death-ray} weapons of some sort.

Apply these rules to {death-ray} weapons:

* Always roll one die, at 2+ to hit regardless of the target's actual Armour value.
* {death-ray} weapons are so potent that when they hit a war engine they always cause critical damage.
Roll on the target war engine's Critical Damage table.
