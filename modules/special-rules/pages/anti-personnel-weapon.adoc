= Anti-Personnel [weapon]

When you shoot with one of these super heavy weapons, roll a number of dice equal to the Firepower value of the unit.
Do not use the Firepower table for this attack.

Discard any natural results of 6, and then discard misses as normal. The remaining dice are hits -- allocate them as you would for a regular Firepower attack.
