= War engines and Blast markers

Blast markers affect War Engine detachments in much the same way as other units.
However, *all* War Engine detachments have the {stubborn} ability.

You may add +1 to the result of Leadership tests when the total initial Damage Capacity value of the War Engine detachment is `15` or more, instead when it has `15` or more units.


.Ork Great Gargant
====
A Great Gargant is a war engine with an initial Damage Capacity value of 18.

You may add +1 to the result of Leadership tests, even if the Great Gargant's current Damage Capacity value falls below 15.
====

.Imperial Guard Super Heavy Tank Company
====
Baneblades are war engines with an initial Damage Capacity value of 4.

A detachment of four Baneblades has a total initial Damage Capacity value of 16, so you may add +1 to the result of Leadership tests.

If the detachment is reduced to three Baneblades the total is 12, so you cannot add +1 to the result of Leadership tests.
