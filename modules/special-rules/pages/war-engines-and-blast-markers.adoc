= War engines and Blast markers

Blast markers affect War Engine detachments in much the same way as other units. 
However, *all* War Engine detachments have the {stubborn} ability.

Note that for a War Engine detachment has a total initial Damage Capacity value of more than `15`, you may add +1 to the result of the Leadership test.
{blank}[TODO: Is this the best place to highlight this point? I think it might be better to improve the Leadership test text and to clarify what is what when it comes to 'number of units' and 'detachment strength' and initial Damage Capacity versus current Damage Capacity for the purposes of the Leadership test.]
