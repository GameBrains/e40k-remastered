= Ork Initiative

Always ready for a krumpin, Orks will often charge into melee before the enemy has even realised that the Orks are close enough to charge them!

Apply these rules to Ork armies:

* Before drawing an Initiative counter in the Assault phase, put any already-drawn Ork Initiative counters back into the mug.

TIP: This makes it more likely that the Ork player will have the initiative and choose who will assault first.
