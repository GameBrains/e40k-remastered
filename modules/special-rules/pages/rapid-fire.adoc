= Rapid Fire

`Unit ability`

These units specialise in laying down heavy fire as soon as they take up position.

====
In comparison to _Epic 40,000_, we've changed the {rapid-fire} ability from doubling the Firepower value to increasing it by 1. This doesn't affect any of the original units with {rapid-fire} as they all had Firepower 1, but this allows us to add new units with Firepower 2 or higher and {rapid-fire}, without them becoming overpowered.

Where your unit has the {rapid-fire} ability:

* Add +1 to its Firepower value when it is on Overwatch orders.

NOTE: Units that have the {heavy-weapons} ability cannot use the {rapid-fire} ability.
