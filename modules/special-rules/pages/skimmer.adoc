= Skimmer

`Unit ability`

{blank}[TODO: add introductory text.]

---

Where your unit has the {skimmer} ability:

* You may ignore terrain when you move the unit â€” though you must still take a dangerous terrain test if the unit is in dangerous terrain at the start or end of the move, and you may not place the unit on impassable terrain.
* In the Shooting phase, you may make a 'pop-up' attack with the unit.
In such an attack, the unit rises up so that it can see over intervening terrain and target an enemy that lies beyond.
** When you make a pop-up attack with the unit, you can draw a line of sight over intervening terrain.
** The unit remains 'popped up' for the remainder of the Shooting phase -- it returns to ground level at the end of the phase.
In the meantime, your opponent can also draw a line over intervening terrain to shoot back.
