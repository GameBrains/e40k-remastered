Some vehicles with legs are particularly manoeuvrable.

We've brought this ability into the main body of the rules.
In _Epic 40,000_ it was a suggestion in the _Battles Book_, later confirmed in Official Rule Amendments and Errata, _Firepower_, issue 1.

Where a Vehicle unit has the {walker} ability:

* The unit counts as an Infantry unit for terrain effects on movement.
+
NOTE: To be clear, the unit does not benefit from an Infantry Armour bonus for cover.
* For a charge move in the Assault phase, you may double the Speed value of the unit if this will bring it into contact with an enemy unit -- just as you can with an Infantry unit.
