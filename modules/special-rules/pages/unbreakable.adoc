= Unbreakable

Some troops have such high morale, or lack of individual willpower, that they never break.

====
In comparison to _Epic 40,000_, we've separated this ability from part of the Tyranid Synapse Creatures rules.

Where your detachment has the {unbreakable} ability:

* The detachment can never become Broken.

NOTE: If you lose a close combat or firefight with the detachment then you must still make a Retreat move with it -- unless it also has the (no-retreat} ability.
