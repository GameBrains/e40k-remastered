= Unbreakable

Some troops have such high morale, or lack of individual willpower, that they never break.

In comparison to _Epic 40,000_, we've separated this ability from part of the Tyranid Synapse Creatures rules.

Where your detachment has the {unbreakable} ability:

* The detachment can never become Broken.

{blank}[TODO: What about the Retreat move? The "can never be broken" aspect of the original Tyranid Synapse Creatures rule includes text about this: link:https://thehobby.zone/resources/e40k-compendium/Content/Armies/ArmiesOfTheTyranids/HiveFleetArmyList.htm[Hive Fleet army list^] (external URL).
