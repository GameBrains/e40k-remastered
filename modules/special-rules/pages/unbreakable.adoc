= Unbreakable

`Detachment ability`

Some troops have such high morale, or lack of individual willpower, that they never break.

====
In comparison to _Epic 40,000_, we separated this ability from parts of the Tyranid 'Synapse Creatures' rules and the 'No retreat, no surrender' rules for war engines.

Where your detachment has the {unbreakable} ability:

* The detachment can never become Broken.

NOTE: If you lose a close combat or firefight with the detachment then you must still make a Retreat move with it -- unless it also has the {no-retreat} ability.
