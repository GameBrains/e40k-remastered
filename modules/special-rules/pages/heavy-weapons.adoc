= Heavy Weapons

`Data sheet modifier`

These units specialise in shooting, with weapons that give them longer range and more firepower.

Of course, their advantages in shooting come at a cost to their effectiveness in close combat.
Common examples include Ork Shooty Boyz and Space Marine Devastators.

Where your unit has the {heavy-weapons} ability, apply these changes relative to their base unit:

* Add +1 to their Firepower value.
* Increase their Range value to `45 cm`.
