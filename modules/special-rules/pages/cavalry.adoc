= Cavalry

Despite the abundance and variety of technologies in the galaxy of the 41^st^ millennium, armies still find uses for cavalry -- and not only on the most barbaric worlds.

Of course, riders and their mounts vary enormously -- humans on horses, denizens of Chaos on daemonic steeds, orks on cyboars, and many more.

Apply these rules to {cavalry} units:

* Double their original Speed value.
* During Assault moves, their original Speed value is tripled if this will bring them into base contact with enemy units, or doubled if it won't.
* Treat {cavalry} units as Vehicle units -- mounts find it difficult to take cover, to move through buildings or rubble, and so on.

NOTE: The part of {cavalry} that increased the unit's Armour value in 3rd edition has been split off into the new xref:armour-1.adoc[Armour +1] ability.
