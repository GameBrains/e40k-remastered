= Cavalry

Despite the abundance and variety of technologies in the galaxy of the 41^st^ millennium, armies still find uses for cavalry -- and not only on the most barbaric worlds.

Of course, riders and their mounts vary enormously -- humans on horses, denizens of Chaos on daemonic steeds, orks on cyboars, and many more.

Apply these rules to {cavalry} units, relative to the base units:

* Double their Speed value.
* During the Assault phase, triple their Speed value if they charge into close combat.
* For the purposes of movement, treat {cavalry} units as Vehicle units -- mounts find it difficult to take cover, to move through buildings or rubble, and so on.
* Add +1 to their Armour value, up to a maximum of 6+.
