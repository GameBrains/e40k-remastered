= Vortex Missile

This weapon is among the most destructive one-shot missile systems ever created.

When the warhead detonates it creates a ravening vortex of energy which actually creates a giant rift between the warp and reality.
This is like the effect of the {distortion-cannon}, but greater and thus particularly effective against war engines.

The vortex consumes anything it contacts in the brief moments before it collapses and the rift vanishes.
