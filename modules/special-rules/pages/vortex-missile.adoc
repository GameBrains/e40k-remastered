= Vortex Missile

This weapon is among the most destructive one-shot missile systems ever created.

When the warhead detonates it creates a ravening vortex of energy which actually creates a giant rift between the warp and reality.
This is like the effect of the {distortion cannon}, but greater and thus particularly effective against war engines.

The vortex consumes anything it contacts in the brief moments before it collapses and the rift vanishes.

When you shoot with a {vortex-missile}:

. Place a Barrage template over the target unit(s).
. For each target unit under the template, roll a D6 and make this many shots equivalent to {death-ray}.
. Once the Vortex missile has been fired it is expended and may not be used again during the battle.

NOTE: Vortex missiles are extremely powerful, so we limit their use to significant War Engine units.
