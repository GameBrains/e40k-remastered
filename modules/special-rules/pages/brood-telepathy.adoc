= Brood Telepathy

Among the members of a Genestealer Cult, there is a strong psychic link -- the telepathy of the hive mind.
This gives the Cult strong morale.

While at least one Genestealer Patriarch or Magus is present in your Genestealer Cult detachment you automatically pass any Leadership test that you are required to make for them.

+[TODO: Should we clarify that this is like the Tyranid Synapse Creatures rule, but not as strong because the detachment can still become Broken?]+
