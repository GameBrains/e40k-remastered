= Hit and Run

`Detachment ability`

Some forces have honed tactics in which they make a lightning assault, seemingly from nowhere, and then disappear just as suddenly.

---

Apply these rules to detachments which have the {hit-and-run} ability:

* After a close combat or firefight with this detachment, you can always make a retreat move -- even if you win.
+
+[TODO: As written, it seems that they can make the retreat move even if they were charged by the enemy first. Is this intended? It doesn't seem to fit with the idea of 'hit and run'.]+
+
In effect, your detachment attacks the enemy and then withdraws to safety to avoid a retaliatory assault from other nearby enemy detachments.
+
IMPORTANT: If any of the units in the detachment are within 15 cm of the enemy at the end of the retreat move then they are destroyed, just as they are for Broken detachments.
