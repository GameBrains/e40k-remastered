= Rampage

`Unit ability`

Some units are so ferocious in close combat that they will rampage through enemy forces in a berserk fury, heedless of their own safety.

---

Where your unit has the {rampage} ability:

* When you roll for hits in close combat, roll two dice to score hits with this unit rather than the usual one die.
* If the unit is in base contact with an enemy unit, it cannot retreat from close combat.
If you lose a close combat, make the Retreat move as normal with other units in the detachment but do not move these units.
This means that these units are always caught and destroyed by the enemy if they are on the losing side in a close combat.
