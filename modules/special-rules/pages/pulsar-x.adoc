When you shoot with a {pulsar-x}:

. Determine the number of shots, based on the value of `(X)` that we specify â€” for example, _`(D3+1)`_ or _`(D6)`_.
. Resolve that many {macro-weapon} shots against the target detachment.

IMPORTANT: Remember that a {pulsar-x} is a single super-heavy weapon.
It does *not* count as multiple super-heavy weapons for placement of Blast markers, suppression, contribution to firefights, or any other game purpose.
