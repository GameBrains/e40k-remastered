= Psychic Null

`Unit ability`

Some rare individuals can somehow sever the connection between the Warp and real-space in their immediate surroundings.
Among other things, this means that psychic powers simply don't work on them or near them.

Where your unit has the {psychic-null} ability:

* Your opponent cannot target this unit with a Psychic Attack Fate card, such as Psychic Blast.
* Where this unit is in base contact with an enemy {psyker} unit, your opponent cannot use that unit to channel the effects of a Psychic Attack Fate card, such as Psychic Blast.
* Where this unit is in base contact with an enemy {psyker} unit, that unit does not count towards your opponent's total number of {psyker} units in the assault.
