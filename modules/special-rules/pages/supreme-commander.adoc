Where your unit has the {supreme-commander} ability:

* All of your detachments that have their HQ unit within 30 cm of the {supreme-commander} unit gain the {stubborn} ability.
* If this specific unit fights in a close combat or contributes its Firepower to a firefight then you may re-roll the die that decides the outcome of that close combat or firelight.
If you re-roll the die then you must abide by the second result.
