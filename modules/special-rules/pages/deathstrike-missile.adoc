= Deathstrike Missile

A powerful one-shot missile.
Though not as devastating as a {vortex-missile}, it is a weapon that inspires justifiable dread.

---

When you shoot with a {deathstrike-missile} weapon, place a Barrage template over the target unit(s).
For each unit under the template, roll a D6 and make this many {anti-tank} shots against it. [TODO: Check that I have interpreted this right -- the original text was ambiguous.]

IMPORTANT: After you shoot a {deathstrike-missile}, that's it -- you can't use it again in the battle.
