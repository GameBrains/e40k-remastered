= Tyranid Objectives

`Army ability`

The Hive Mind hungers only for biomass and genetic material.
It doesn't seek to hold ground or capture objectives.

When you field a Tyranid army, apply these rules:

* The army does not use objectives, regardless of what scenario you play.
* After you destroy an enemy detachment, add its morale value to your army morale in the Rally phase.
