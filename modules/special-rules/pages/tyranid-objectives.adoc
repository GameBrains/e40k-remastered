= Tyranid Objectives

Always ready for a krumpin, Orks will often charge into melee before the enemy has even realised that the Orks are close enough to charge them!

---

Apply these rules to Tyranid armies:

* The army does not use objectives, regardless of scenario.
* If an enemy detachment is wiped out, add its morale value to the Tyranid player's army morale in the Rally phase. [either/or]
* If an enemy detachment is wiped out, in the Rally phase the Tyranid player's army morale goes up by the detachment's morale value. [either/or]

NOTE: If the enemy detachment is a war engine that has been destroyed -- rather than being wrecked -- this is in addition to gaining half the war engines's morale value.
