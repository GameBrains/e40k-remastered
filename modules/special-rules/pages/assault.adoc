= Assault

`Data sheet modifier`

These units specialise in close combat, through a combination of skills, doctrine and equipment.

Of course, their advantages in close combat come at a cost to their long-range firepower.

---

Where your unit has the {assault} ability, apply these changes relative to their base unit:

* Add +1 to their Assault value.
* Reduce their Range value to `15 cm`.

Where your unit has both the {assault} ability *and* the {heavy-weapons} ability, apply these changes relative to their base unit:

* Halve their Assault value, then add +1 to that total to get their new value (round up).
* Increase their Range value to `45 cm`.
