= Hitch (X)

{blank}[TODO: Add introductory description.]

---

Where your unit has the {hitch} ability:

* The {hitch} unit can carry as many Infantry units as we state in brackets.
For example, the Battlefortress has {hitch-4} -- so you can embark up to four Infantry units, as we explain in the main transport rules.

NOTE: A {hitch} unit does not gain the abilities of embarked units.
