= Hitch (X)

`Unit ability`

{blank}[TODO: Add introductory description.]

---

Where your unit has the {hitch-x} ability:

* The {hitch-x} unit can carry as many Infantry units as we state in brackets.
For example, the Ork Battlefortress has {hitch-4} -- so you can embark up to four Infantry units, as we explain in the main transportation rules.

NOTE: A {hitch-x} unit does not gain the abilities of embarked units.
