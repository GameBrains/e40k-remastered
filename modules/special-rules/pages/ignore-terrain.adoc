= Ignore Terrain

Some units can stalk with ease through terrain that is treacherous for others.

====
In comparison to _Epic 40,000_, we derived this ability from part of the rules for Tyranid war engines.
This allows for more flexibility in unit design.

Where your unit has the {ignore-terrain} ability:

* While you move the unit, you can have it cross dangerous terrain without need for a dangerous terrain test, or even cross impassable terrain.

{blank}[TODO: Should we qualify this to the effect that you can't end a move on impassable terrain (probably best), or at least that you can't end a chain of moves on impassable terrain?]
