Able to slip through terrain easily, or simply barge through it regardless, units such as Hierodule and Hierophant Bio-Titans are never slowed by terrain.

---

Apply these rules to units with the {ignore-terrain} ability:

* While moving, the unit can cross dangerous and impassible terrain and does not take dangerous terrain tests.
