= Ignore Terrain

`Unit ability`

Some units can stalk with ease through terrain that is treacherous for others.

====
In comparison to _Epic 40,000_, we derived this ability from part of the rules for Tyranid war engines.
This allows for more flexibility in unit design.

Where your unit has the {ignore-terrain} ability:

* You may ignore terrain when you move the unit, and you never take dangerous terrain tests for it. You may not place the unit on impassable terrain.
