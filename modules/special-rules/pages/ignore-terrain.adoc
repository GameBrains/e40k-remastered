= Ignore Terrain

`Unit ability`
footnote:[{e40k-diff}We derived this ability from part of {e40k}'s rules for Tyranid War Engine units. This allows for more flexibility in unit design.]

Some units can stalk with ease through terrain that is treacherous for others.

---

Where your unit has the {ignore-terrain} ability:

* While you move the unit, you can have it cross dangerous terrain without need for a dangerous terrain test, or even cross impassable terrain.
+
{blank}[TODO: Should we qualify this to the effect that you can't end a move on impassable terrain (probably best), or at least that you can't end a chain of moves on impassable terrain?]
