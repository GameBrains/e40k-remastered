= Fast

This ability applies to some Vehicle unit variants.
It represents vehicles which have been stripped of weapons or armour to increase their speed.

---

Apply these rules to units that have the {fast} ability, relative to their base units:

* Increase their Speed value by 5 cm.
* Reduce their Firepower value by 1 -- or if this would result in a Firepower value of 0, then reduce their Armour value by 1 instead.
