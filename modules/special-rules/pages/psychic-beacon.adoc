`Detachment ability`

Genestealer Patriarchs emit a strong psychic signal, which guides the parent Hive Fleet to the planet.

When you field an army that includes detachments that have the {psychic-beacon} ability:

* For each undestroyed detachment with the {psychic-beacon} ability, you may re-roll one failed Reserves roll per turn.

The _Epic 40,000_ version of this ability was exceptionally cheap and powerful, enabling all Mycetic Swarm detachments in the army to automatically arrive in turn 1. This revised version scales with the number of detachments with the ability.
