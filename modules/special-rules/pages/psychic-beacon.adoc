`Detachment ability`
footnote:[{e40k-diff}
The {e40k} version of this ability is exceptionally cheap and powerful -- for only a small cost, it allows all Mycetic Swarm detachments in the army to arrive in turn 1, automatically.
We've revised the ability so that it scales with the number of detachments that have the ability, and so that it improves rather than bypasses the odds on the Reserve Detachment Arrival table.
This also means that the earliest a Mycetic Swarm detachment can arrive from Reserves is turn 2, just like other Reserves.

When you field an army that includes detachments that have the {psychic-beacon} ability:

* For each undestroyed detachment with the {psychic-beacon} ability, you may re-roll one failed Reserves roll per turn.
