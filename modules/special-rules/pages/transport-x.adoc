{blank}[TODO: Add introductory description.]

---

Where your unit has the {transport} ability:

* The {transport} unit can carry as many Infantry units as we state in brackets.
For example, the Rhino has {transport-2} -- so you can embark up to two Infantry units in a Rhino.

NOTE: A {transport} unit does not gain the abilities of embarked units.
For example a {transport} unit that carries a unit with the {save} ability does not gain the {save} ability.
