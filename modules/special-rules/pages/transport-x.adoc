= Transport (X)

{blank}[TODO: Add introductory description.]

---

Where your unit has the {transport} ability:

* The {transport} unit can carry as many Infantry units as we state in brackets.
For example, the Rhino has {transport-2} -- so you can embark up to two Infantry units in a Rhino, as we explain in the main transportation rules.

NOTE: A {transport} unit does not gain the abilities of embarked units.
