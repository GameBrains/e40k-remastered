= Close Combat Weapons

War engines make excellent gun platforms, but some of them trade some firepower for weapons that afford greater potency in close combat.

Such weapons include huge powered fists, saws and rams, ripping tentacles, fierce short-ranged cutting torches, and more besides.
Their primary purpose is to gain a big advantage over other war engines and mangle them in close combat.

Apply these rules where your war engine is armed with {close-combat-weapons}:

* Double its Assault value when it fights against an enemy war engine in close combat.
* When it wins a close combat against an enemy war engine, it automatically inflicts *catastrophic* damage.
Make one roll on the losing war engine's Catastrophic Damage table to find out what happens to it.
