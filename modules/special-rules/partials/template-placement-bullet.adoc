. Place a Barrage template so that it:
* is completely within range and line of sight of the firer
+
NOTE: If the unit or weapon also has {artillery}, the template does not need to be in line of sight of the firer.

 Editing note, I've added 'or weapon' to the Artillery note for future-proofing purposes. For example if Carapace Landing Pads get added, and they allow one weapon that uses the Barrage template to fire with the Artillery rule.
