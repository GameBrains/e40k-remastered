= Assault moves and charges

During the Assault phase you may only move and attack with detachments that you placed on Assault orders in the Movement phase.

== Movement in the Assault phase

For all your detachments that are on Assault orders, you *must* move all of their units *at least 5 cm* towards the enemy if you can.

IMPORTANT: For detachments that have Blast markers on them, you must pass a Leadership test before you can move them.

* You don't have to move these units more than 5 cm, unless you want to.
+
(You may simply want to manoeuvre into range for a firefight or to grab an objective, for example.)
+
However, you may not move assaulting units *past* any enemy units footnote:[To avoid a lengthy explanation here we discuss this in more detail at +[TODO: FAQ -- Moving past in the Assault phase]+.] -- unless those enemies are already engaged in close combat with other friendly units.
* You must move these units towards the enemy -- but not necessarily towards the _nearest_ enemy.
* You can move these units less than 5 cm *only* where they charge into close combat (base contact) with enemy units that are within 5 cm.

Otherwise, moves in the Assault phase are subject to all the rules we described for the Movement phase -- except that the Snap-fire rule does not apply in the Assault phase.

== Charge

As you move detachments in this phase, you may declare that any or all of them will *charge* so that they become engaged in close combat with the enemy.

This is the only time that you may move your units into base contact with enemy units.
And where you do move any individual unit into base contact with an enemy unit, we call this a *charge move*.

* You don't have to declare and make a charge into close combat unless you want to, with one exception: If the 'must move towards the enemy' and 'must move at least 5 cm, or into base contact' requirements force you to place units in base contact, then you have made charge moves by definition and so you have a charge whether you like it or not!
Of course you may move more units into base contact, where they can reach.
* If you don't get at least one unit into base contact with an enemy then there are no charge moves by definition, which means that the detachment does not charge and there will be no close combat.
(Though there will be a firefight if any units are within 15cm of the enemy.)

You can benefit from a special increase to the Speed value of some particular units when you make a charge move with them.
(Remember, it is only a charge move if the units will get into base contact with the enemy -- you don't get the increase if they won't get into base contact.)

* You may double the Speed value of any *Infantry* unit, unless it has the {swift} ability.
* Where a unit has the {swift} ability, you may increase its Speed value by 50% (1.5x).
* For any other unit, use its Speed value in the usual way.

We changed the explanation of charge moves and integrated the new {swift} ability, to make charge moves and special increases to Speed values easier to understand.
