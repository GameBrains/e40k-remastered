= Orders and conditions

+[TODO: Graphics for orders and conditions.]+

By default, every detachment is ready to move and shoot each turn, under <<Advance>> orders.
However, during the course of the turn you may elect to can give a detachment a different set of orders, to change how they can behave during that turn.

However, if a detachment is subject to any <<Conditions>> then you may *not* be able to give them any orders at all -- at least, not until something happens to remove the condition.

We use markers to remind us which orders or conditions are in effect with which detachments.

== Orders

As long as a detachment is not subject to any <<Conditions>> then you may give it orders (during the Movement phase, usually).

=== Advance

These are the orders that a detachment operates under by default, and you don't need a marker to indicate this.

Movement phase:: You may make a move with units in this detachment.
Shooting phase:: You may shoot with the units in this detachment.
Assault phase:: You may *not* move the units in this detachment.

=== Assault
image::Orders_Assault.png[role="left"]
These orders allow a detachment to close with the enemy more quickly, at the cost of less effective shooting as they 'shoot from the hip'.
Also, these are the only orders that allow your detachment to move into close combat with the enemy.

Movement phase:: You may make a move with units in this detachment.
Shooting phase:: You may shoot with the units in this detachment -- but you must *halve* their total Firepower.
Assault phase:: You *must* move the units in this detachment, at least 5 cm towards the enemy (though not necessarily the nearest enemy).
+
Any of your units that reaches base-to-base contact with at least one enemy unit is *charging into close combat*. As part of a charge, you may use the *second* Speed value of units *if* this will bring them into base-to-base contact with the enemy.

=== March
image::Orders_March.png[role="left"]
These orders allow a detachment to move very quickly -- but it can't shoot, and it will be very vulnerable if it is attacked.

TIP: Be careful! Detachments on March orders are especially vulnerable to enemy attacks.

Movement phase:: You may make a *triple* move with units in this detachment. That is, make three normal moves in a single sequence.
Shooting phase:: You may *not* shoot with units in this detachment.
+
If your opponent shoots at this detachment then they will use the Marching column on the Firepower table.
Assault phase:: You may *not* move units in this detachment.
+
If the detachment becomes engaged in close combat or a firefight then and you must *halve* the detachment's Assault and Firepower totals.

=== Overwatch
image::Orders_Overwatch.png[role="left"]
These orders cause a detachment to forgo most of its movement in favour of more accurate shooting.

Movement phase:: You may move units in this detachment up to 5 cm only.
Shooting phase:: You may shoot with units in this detachment -- and you may *re-roll any misses* you roll with the hit dice.
+
+[TODO: Is there any edge case where the detachment might be allowed to shoot outside of the Shooting phase? If so, then might need a note to the effect that the re-roll applies to shooting outside of the Shooting phase as well.]+
Assault phase:: You may *not* move units in this detachment.

=== Special
image::Orders_Special.png[role="left"]
We use this marker to indicate that special orders that are in effect, such as xref:special-rules:flak.adoc[] or xref:special-rules:artillery.adoc#preparatory-bombardment[Preparatory Bombardment].

+[TODO: Need to consider some possible edge cases -- eg, if Flak orders apply to individual units then we might needs to tweak some of the explanations which assume everything is done on a whole detachment basis.]+

== Conditions
You cannot give a detachment orders while it is subject to a condition.
When a detachment becomes subject to a condition then any orders that were in effect are no longer valid -- remove the order marker (if any) and place the appropriate condition marker.

=== Broken
image::Conditions_Broken.png[role="left"]
A detachment becomes Broken when it loses a close combat or a firefight.
This means that the detachment is in disarray -- units are in a state of confusion or even panic, seeking cover and unable to accept and respond to orders.

TIP: Be careful! Broken detachments are especially vulnerable to encirclement and enemy attacks.

Movement phase:: You may make *only* a 20 cm *Retreat* move with units in this detachment (though you don't have to move them at all if you don't want to).
Shooting phase:: You may *not* shoot with units in this detachment.
Assault phase:: You may *not* move units in this detachment.
+
If the detachment becomes engaged in close combat or a firefight then and you must *halve* the detachment's Assault and Firepower totals.

=== Immobilised
image::Conditions_Immobilised.png[role="left"]
This condition applies when a war engine sustains damage that causes it to become immobile.
This might be a temporary condition if it can be repaired, or it might last for the rest of the game.

This condition is like being under Advance orders, except that the war engine can't move and becomes even easier to hit with shooting.

Movement phase:: You may *not* move this war engine, at all -- not even to turn on the spot.
Shooting phase:: You may shoot with this war engine as normal.
+
If your opponent shoots at this war engine then they will use the appropriate Immobilised column on the Firepower table.
Assault phase:: You may *not* move this war engine, at all -- not even to turn on the spot.
Other:: Immobilised war engines may not use special orders.
If a war engine becomes Immobilised while it is under special orders then those orders are cancelled.
+
Where the rules state that the war engine is immobilised 'until repaired', you may attempt to repair the war engine at the appropriate step in the Rally phase.

+[TODO: In contrast to other orders and conditions, Immobilised affects a single war engine at a time. What happens as far as orders are concerned for other war engines in the same detachment? Some refinement of the text will be necessary to clarify this.]+
