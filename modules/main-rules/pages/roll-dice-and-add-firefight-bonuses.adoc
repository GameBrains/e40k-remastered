= FF3. Roll dice and add firefight bonuses

Both players: Roll a D6 and add your firefight bonuses to the result.

* The player with the highest total score wins the firefight.
* If the total scores are the same then the outcome hangs in the balance! Place one Blast marker on every detachment in the firefight and then *roll again*.
