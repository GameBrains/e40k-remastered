= The Movement phase

The Movement phase is not the only phase in which movement occurs, but it is the main one -- and the decisions you make here will determine much about what you can and can't do for the rest of the turn.

. First, the player with the Initiative must choose either to go first or to make their opponent go first in this phase.
. Then, the first player completes all of their actions for the Movement phase, as explained in this section.
. Finally, the second player completes all of their actions for the Movement phase.

The actions you can take are explained in this section, but in summary: You may move some or all of your units, according to the orders that you give to their detachment.

Some general points about movement:

* When you move a unit, you can move it a distance (in centimetres) up to their Speed value.
* You may turn the unit freely during the course of its move (unless it is a War Engine unit).
* In the Movement phase, it is never compulsory to move any particular unit.
//Possible alternative: * Unless a rule specifically states that you must move a unit in the Movement phase then you do not have to move it in this phase if you don't want to.
* Once you have moved a unit and removed your hand from the model, you may not change the move.
* When you move a unit, you can move it through other friendly units, as long as they are not war engines.
