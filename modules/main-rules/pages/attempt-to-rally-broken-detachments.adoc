= R2. Attempt to rally Broken detachments

If you can rally a Broken detachment then you will regain control so that you can issue orders to it again next turn.

For each Broken detachment that you have, take a Rally test to see if they rally.
This is a standard Leadership test.

.Rally test
Make a standard Leadership test -- all the usual rules for modifiers and such apply.
If you succeed then the detachment rallies -- remove the Broken condition marker from the detachment; otherwise, the detachment remains Broken -- try again in the next Rally phase.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot rally a detachment that has as many Blast markers (or more) as it has units remaining -- you may not attempt the test in such cases.

You may be able to take the test for such detachments at the end of a future turn if you are able to remove enough Blast markers at step xref:roll-to-remove-blast-markers.adoc[].
