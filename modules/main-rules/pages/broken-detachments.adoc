= Broken detachments

image::Conditions_Broken.png[role="left"]
When a detachment becomes Broken, remove its order marker (if any) and place a Broken condition marker.

*A detachment becomes Broken when it loses a close combat or a firefight.*

When a detachment first becomes Broken, you *must* make an immediate <<Retreat move>> with it -- and any units that aren't able to get far enough away from enemy units will be destroyed.

Thereafter, apply the following rules while the detachment remains subject to the Broken condition:

* You cannot give orders to your Broken detachment -- so it can't shoot or enter overwatch, and it can't move in the normal way either.
+[TODO: Can a detachment still Snap-fire while Broken?]+
* You may make a <<Retreat move>> in the Movement phase, if you wish.
This is the only type of move you may make with a Broken detachment.
* If the enemy engages your Broken detachment in close combat or a firefight then you must halve your detachment's Assault and Firepower totals in the engagement.

[[retreat-move]]
== Retreat move

The Retreat move is a single move in which you may move all of the Broken units up to 20cm -- regardless of the actual Speed values of units.

* You may make the Retreat move in any direction, subject to the normal rules for terrain effects on movement.
* If you end a Retreat move such that any Broken units are within 15cm of *any* enemy unit footnote:[Even Broken enemy units.], then they are *destroyed* -- remove those units as casualties.
(They are killed by the advancing enemy or scattered in the confusion -- they play no further part in the battle.)

== The Broken condition and the 'out of command' rules

If a Broken detachment has units that are out of command (that is, more than 30cm away from their detachment HQ unit) then those units are not affected -- they are not Broken and the out of command rules still apply to them.

If units that are out of command become Broken, remove them as casualties immediately.
There are no other effects on the parent detachment.
Similarly, if units in a Broken detachment become out of command, remove them as casualties immediately.

== Rallying a Broken detachment

You may be able to rally Broken detachments in the End phase.
