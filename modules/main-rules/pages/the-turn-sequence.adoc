= The turn sequence

You play a game of {project-name} over a number of *turns* in which both you and your opponent participate.
How many turns is dependent upon the scenario that you play and the victory conditions it specifies.

+[TODO: We might not need this any more, given the addition of a defined Start Phase. Or anything that would appear here could be in the Start phase instead perhaps. To verify. We should probably mention the need to put Initiative counters in a mug/bag/whatever either here or at the end of the turn.]+
