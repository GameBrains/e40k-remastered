= The turn sequence

You play a game of {project-name} over a number of *turns* in which both you and your opponent participate.
How many turns is dependent upon the scenario that you play and the victory conditions it specifies.

****
There are a number of *phases* in a turn, in a fixed sequence that we call the *turn sequence*.

During the turn sequence, you and your opponent will give *orders* to your detachments.

The orders define *what* actions you can take with your units, and the phases in the turn sequence define *when* you can take those actions.
