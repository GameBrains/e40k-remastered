= CC2. Work out close combat bonuses
:bonus-cc:

Each player receives bonuses in close combat for the Assault value of their units, whether they are supported by {psyker} units, which side has more Blast markers, and so on.
These are summarised on the <<#assault-bonuses-table>>.

Note that the bonus you receive for the Assault value total of your units depends on how it compares with your opponent's Assault value total -- you don't add your Assault value total onto your die roll!
