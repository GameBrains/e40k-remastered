= Firefight procedure

A firefight takes place if there is an enemy detachment within 15 cm after a player has resolved his close combats.
Note that it is possible for a detachment to be involved in a close combat and then take part in a firefight immediately afterwards.
If a detachment has any units within 15 cm of an enemy detachment a firelight must be resolved between the two detachments.
When several firefights occur in the same turn the player with the Initiative may decide what order to resolve them in.
